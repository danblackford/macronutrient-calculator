This calculator will calculate your recommended daily caloric intake, as well as your recommended daily protein, carbohydrate, and fat intake.

Your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) is calculated as follows:

male BMR = 66 + (6.23 * weight) + (12.7 * height) - (6.8 * age)
female BMR = 655 + (4.35 * weight) + (4.7 * height) - (4.7 * age)

The BMR is then multiplied by the activity level to calculate your Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE), which can be used as your daily caloric intake:

sedentary = BMR * 1.2
lightly active = BMR * 1.375
moderately active = BMR * 1.55
very active = BMR * 1.725
extra active = BMR * 1.9

Calories are then increased or reduced based on your goal:

maintain weight = calories remain the same
quickly lose weight = calories - 500
lose weight = calories - 250
gain weight = calories + 250
quickly gain weight = calories + 500

Calories from each macronutrient are calculated as follows:

calories from protein = calories * 0.25
calories from carbohydrates = calories * 0.5
calories from fats = calories * 0.25

Grams of each macronutrient are calculated as follows:

grams of protein = calories from protein / 4
grams of carbohydrates = calories from carbohydrates / 4
grams of fats = calories from fats / 9

***All calculations are based on dietary and caloric recommendations from harvard.edu and healthline.com
